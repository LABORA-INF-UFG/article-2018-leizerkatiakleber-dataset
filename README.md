# An Exact and Polynomial Approach for a Bi-Objective Integer Programming Problem Regarding Network Flow Routing

Here we present the evaluations of several computational experiments. Grid (with 49, 100, 225 and 400 nodes) and random networks (with 50, 100, 200 and 400 nodes) were considered. The random topology was generated by the Barab\'{a}si-Albert model. The settings of the network flows defined here are common in wireless sensor networks and wireless mesh networks. We evaluated scenarios, with 80 and 300 flows, employing 100 instances of each topology type.
