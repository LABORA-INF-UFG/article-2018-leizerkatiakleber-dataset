# An Exact and Polynomial Approach for a Bi-Objective Integer Programming Problem Regarding Network Flow Routing -- Extras

Here we present the results of many additional computational experiments that are not available in the paper. While these results do not add relevant information to the work, they extend sensibly the computational evaluation. The results are organized in two groups: different number of nodes and different costs. In the first group, the number of nodes varies as follows: grid topology {49, 100, 225, 400} and random topology {50, 100, 200, 400}. In the second group, the cost of each edge is randomly chosen as a value of the following set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
