## Different costs

### [different_costs-grid-multiple_destination-100nodes-80_300flows.xlsx](different_costs-grid-multiple_destination-100nodes-80_300flows.xlsx)
The results presented are for the grid graph topology with 100 nodes and varying the number of flows (r=80; r=300) , with different costs (c^f_sd in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}). The sources are multiple and the destination are multiple for the 100 instances.

### [different_costs-grid-single_destination-100nodes-80_300flows.xlsx](different_costs-grid-single_destination-100nodes-80_300flows.xlsx)
The results presented are for the grid graph topology with 100 nodes and varying the number of flows (r=80; r=300), with different costs (c^f_sd in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}). The sources are multiple and with one single destination for the 100 instances.

### different_costs-rand-multiple_destination-100nodes-80_300flows.xlsx:
The results presented are for the rand graph topology with 100 nodes and varying the number of flows (r=80; r=300), with different costs (c^f_sd in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}). The sources are multiple and the destination are multiple for the 100 instances.

### different_costs-grid-equal_destination-100nodes-80_300flows.xlsx:
The results presented are for the rand graph topology with 100 nodes and varying the number of flows (r=80; r=300), with different costs (c^f_sd in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}). The sources are multiple and with one single destination for the 100 instances.
